/*
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *   This is a dummy application that will exhibit a specific behaviour. The
 *   imagined driver auther has made a small error: When the driver's only
 *   binary file is read more than once in succession, after the 1st read,
 *   no data is ever returned. This was not the driver's intent. We are
 *   imagining that the device always has some informaton to give us, so the
 *   file should essentially be "infinite" in length.
 *
 *   We will be able to use ftrace to debug this problem as described in the
 *   blog to which this code is associated.
 *
 *   To help use ftrace from within our application a very small and simple
 *   library is used to make our lives a little easier. This library hides the
 *   details of what we're doing with frace, but provides a nice little API
 *   should you ever wish to use ftrace in this manner.
